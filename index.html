          <h3>Abstract</h3>
          <p style="text-align: left;"> This interdisciplinary workshop centers on the emerging paradigm of human-robot symbiosis in manufacturing Metaverse (HRSyM), 
            aiming to enhance the scale and efficiency of manufacturing systems. By integrating advanced technologies like embodied intelligence, 
            foundation models, digital twins and mixed reality, HRSyM enables seamless interaction, 
            collaboration, and operational optimization within human-robot agents across both shared physical workspaces and 
            remote virtual factory environments—transcending traditional physical, spatial, and temporal boundaries. Through engaging talks and panel discussions, 
            we bring together researchers from manufacturing, robotics, AI, and mixed reality to discuss key challenges, 
            such as enabling high-fidelity 3D construction of fused physical-virtual environments, 
            industrial scene spatial intelligence, human-robot augmented operation skills throughout the production lifecycle, 
            and physics-based intelligence for dexterous manipulation. The discussions will also explore practical applications in assembly, welding, grinding, 
            polishing, and maintenance within smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0/5.0. This workshop seeks to bridge theory and practice, 
            driving innovation and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration to shape the future of manufacturing. </p>

          <h3>Content</h3>
          <p style="text-align: left;"> Manufacturing Metaverse plays a pivotal role in creating an expansive digital manufacturing environment 
            that frees humans from the limitations of body, mind, space, 
            and time, significantly increasing the scale and efficiency of production. 
            Especially as robots continue to advance in intelligence—prevailing cooperation, interaction, 
            and collaboration with humans—a human-robot symbiosis paradigm toward the manufacturing Metaverse (HRSyM) is emerging, 
            igniting mixed reactions and discussions. 
            This paradigm offers promising solutions to critical industry challenges such as an aging workforce, 
            labor shortages, complex production processes, and the rising demand for mass personalization, 
            positioning HRSyM as a key driver of industrial growth. Over the past decade, 
            there has been sustained scientific interest in these techniques, with publications in such areas as Smart Manufacturing (SM), 
            Metaverse, Human-Robot Interaction (HRI), 
            and Human-Robot Collaboration (HRC) experiencing a remarkable surge—growing over tenfold in quantity, 
            with over a thousand papers and tens of thousands of citations each year, as illustrated in Fig. 1. 
            However, a systematic understanding of the human-robot symbiosis connotation on manufacturing Metaverse remains limited. 
            The techniques of HRI, HRC, and Metaverse applied in manufacturing fields are scarcely utilized, even at less than 10%. 
            Therefore, advancing this interdisciplinary domain is crucial to fully enable HRSyM, achieving a balance between productivity 
            improvements and the enrichment of human lifestyles. </p>

            <a>Fig. 1. Research trends on HRSyM in the Web of Science.</a>
          </div><br>
            
          <p style="text-align: left;">To address this issue, we propose an interdisciplinary workshop centered on HRSyM, 
            aligned with the evolution of robotics, smart manufacturing systems, embodied intelligence, 
            digital twins, mixed reality, etc. HRSyM integrates human-robot agents into manufacturing, 
            freeing them from physical and spatial constraints both within and beyond factory environments throughout the product lifecycle. 
            In HRSyM, human-robot agents act as avatars, enabling online interaction with global users in decentralized spaces and physical collaboration on local production lines.
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: left;">Multidisciplinary theories and expertise from manufacturing, robotics, 
            cognitive science, and immersive computing are essential for advancing HRSyM. 
            For instance, scene representation algorithms, such as neural radiance fields and 3D Gaussian Splatting, 
            facilitate high-fidelity reconstruction and rendering of human-robot manufacturing environments for metaverse applications. 
            Additionally, physics-informed neural networks and simulation tools can overlay kinematic, 
            dynamic, and material properties onto digital replicas within the metaverse. Vision Language Models (VLMs), 
            with their powerful reasoning, decision-making, and planning capabilities, 
            enhance human-AI cognition among human-robot agents through interactive chain-of-thought processes, 
            thereby promoting bidirectional proactive assistance—where humans support robots and robots assist humans—to optimize operational processes. 
            Moreover, generative models like diffusion strategies offer promising low-code approaches for robot learning via demonstration, teleoperation, 
            language prompts, brainwaves, and tactile interactions.
          </p>

          <p style="text-align: left;">In this workshop, based on the HRSyM principle, 
            we pursue the high-fidelity 3D construction of integrated physical-virtual environments, 
            advanced spatial intelligence representations of industrial scenes, 
            and enhanced human-robot operational skills across the production lifecycle. 
            We emphasize physics-infused embodied intelligence to achieve precise and dexterous manipulation within metaverse environments, 
            addressing practical applications such as assembly, welding, grinding, polishing, 
            and maintenance in high-end manufacturing within the Industry 4.0/5.0 framework.
            Building on the HRSyM paradigm, the aeroengine turbine blade, 
            a core mechanical component in the aviation industry serves as an ideal case study. 
            HRSyM can effectively manage the blade lifecycle, addressing critical challenges of design variants, 
            increased machining complexity, and high surface quality maintenance, as shown in Fig. 2. 
            During the design stage, the focus is on creating, modifying, and identifying parametric CAD models to meet diverse scenario requirements. 
            In the machining stage, the emphasis shifts to the compliant polishing process, a key finishing technique for blade shaping. 
            This involves generating end-to-end robotic machining trajectories, adaptively adjusting machining parameters, 
            and performing real-time simulations of material removal. The maintenance stage targets surface wear repair through such processes as diagnosis, 
            prognosis, and grinding. Throughout the blade's lifecycle, humans and robots collaborate physically and virtually across production lines, factories, 
            and the broader industry chain, ensuring optimized performance.

          <!-- <h3>Intended audience and expected attendance</h3>
          <p style="text-align: left;"> The intended audience for this workshop includes researchers, practitioners, 
            and industry professionals specializing in robotics, manufacturing systems, 
            AI and mixed reality. We are specifically targeting members of the IEEE RAS Technical Committees (TCs), 
            including Digital Manufacturing and Human-Centered Automation, Collaborative Automation for Flexible Manufacturing, 
            Human-Robot Interaction & Coordination, Robot Learning, and Telerobotics. In addition, 
            we aim to engage communities from related domains such as Smart Manufacturing Standards Committee (IEEE C/SM SC), 
            Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and Control, Robotics, and Mechatronics (TC-CRM). </p>

            
          <p style="text-align: left;">Based on our previous organizing experience with the 19th/20th IEEE CASE special sessions 
            on Human-Robot Collaboration for Futuristic Human-Centric Smart Manufacturing and ICRA 2023 workshop on 
            Cognitive Modeling in Robot Learning for Adaptive Human-Robot Interactions, 
            past events in these domains have attracted a diverse audience from academia, 
            research institutions, and leading industrial enterprises. 
            We expect the event to draw approximately 50–70 participants, bridging theoretical innovation with practical applications for the HRSyM.
