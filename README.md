# Human-Robot Symbiosis Towards Manufacturing Metaverse: Opportunities and Challenges

This interdisciplinary workshop centers on the emerging paradigm of human-robot symbiosis in manufacturing Metaverse (HRSyM), aiming to enhance the scale and efficiency of manufacturing systems. By integrating advanced technologies like embodied intelligence, foundation models, digital twins and mixed reality, HRSyM enables seamless interaction, collaboration, and operational optimization within human-robot agents across both shared physical workspaces and remote virtual factory environmentsâ€”transcending traditional physical, spatial, and temporal boundaries. Through engaging talks and panel discussions, we bring together researchers from manufacturing, robotics, AI, and mixed reality to discuss key challenges, such as enabling high-fidelity 3D construction of fused physical-virtual environments, industrial scene spatial intelligence, human-robot augmented operation skills throughout the production lifecycle, and physics-based intelligence for dexterous manipulation. The discussions will also explore practical applications in assembly, welding, grinding, polishing, and maintenance within smart manufacturing and Industry 4.0/5.0. This workshop seeks to bridge theory and practice, driving innovation and fostering interdisciplinary collaboration to shape the future of manufacturing.
